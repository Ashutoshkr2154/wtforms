## Skills Utilized

In this project, I utilized the following skills and technologies:

- `Python`: The core programming language used for backend development.
- `Flask`: A lightweight web framework used for building the web application.
- `Flask-WTF`: An extension for Flask that integrates WTForms, used for form handling.
- `WTForms`: A flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python.
- `Flask-Bootstrap`: An extension for Flask that integrates Bootstrap, used for styling the application.
- `HTML`: Used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- `CSS`: Used for styling the web application and enhancing its visual appeal.

These skills and technologies enabled me to develop a simple yet functional web application for user login and access control. I gained hands-on experience in building Flask applications, handling forms, and integrating Bootstrap for a polished user interface.
